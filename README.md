# NPR-Politics-Articles-Summaries

*Summary*

Takes articles from the NPR Politics Page and returns summaries of them using LexRankSummarizer(). NPR is parsed using BeautifulSoup4.

**NOTE:** To run in command prompt type chcp 65001 at first. Changes the encoding to utf-8 in the prompt. This will avoid UnicodeErrors.
